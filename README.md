WIP, not ready for use.

## Local development

This application is built with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and the recommended local development flow makes use of the Docker integrations available for modern IDEs (such as [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)). To run the local development container in the background, use the following `docker-compose` command:

```
docker-compose up -d devbox
```

Then attach to the container using your preferred IDE.

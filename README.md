## Overview

**Hyacinth** is a Discord bot which will automatically send you notifications for new listings or postings anywhere on the web.

Taking inspiration from the venerable [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/), Hyacinth provides a unified interface for filtering listings and sending notifications while allowing new sources to be added separately with minimal additional effort.

Hyacinth offers a number of advanced features for power-users, including:

- Complex filtering rules, including text-based filtering using arbitrary boolean rules
- Customizable polling intervals, allowing full control over how often the bot checks for new listings
- Search batching, reducing the number of times listing sources are polled for each search and allowing for more searches before hitting anti-bot measures

For more information and the user guide, please head over to the [documentation](https://slensky.com/hyacinth/).

## Local development

This application is built with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and the recommended local development flow makes use of the Docker integrations available for modern IDEs (such as [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)). To run the local development container in the background, use the following `docker-compose` command:

```
docker-compose up -d devbox
```

Then attach to the container using your favorite IDE.
